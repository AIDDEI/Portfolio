            <h1>First-person Football</h1>
            <p>
                For the course Programming 9, I developed a first-person football game in Unity using C#.
                The goal of the game is simple but competitive: you must score 10 goals before the AI opponent does.
                The match becomes a fast and frantic race to reach the score limit first. Despite the limited
                development timeframe of just one and a half weeks, the game includes a fully functional AI
                opponent, scoring system, and responsive first-person controls -resulting in an engaging and
                replayable prototype.

            <h2>Project Context</h2>
            <p>
                This project was part of the Programming 9 course, where the challange was to create a complete
                playable Unity game under strict time pressure. The objective was to demonstrate programming
                proficiency, apply game-loop logic, and integrate gameplay systems in a short development sprint.
                This resulted in a compact but fully working first-person football experience.
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                I created the entire game independently, including the first-person movement system, ball physics,
                scoring mechanics, and AI behavior. I implemented all gameplay logic in C#, built the environment in
                Unity, and ensured that the game was functional, enjoyable, and aligned with the project requirements
                -all within a tight deadline.
            </p>
