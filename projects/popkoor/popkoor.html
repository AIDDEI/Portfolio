            <h1>Popkoor Singing Beat</h1>
            <p>
                Together with a team of five students, I worked on redesigning and rebuilding the outdated website of
                Popkoor Singing Beat. Their previous website had not been maintained for years, resulting in an
                old-fashioned interface, inconsistent communication channels, and no proper system for practicing music.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our solution was a fully modernized website built with the Laravel PHP framework. The new platform
                centralizes all communication, ensuring members always receive accurate, up-to-date information.
                Administrators can post announcements, upload files, manage members, and keep every page updated
                without technical knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most impactful features is the integrated music practice system. Admins can upload songs
                for choir members to rehearse, and hide them again when they are no longer relevant. The entire website
                is designed to be future-proof, user-friendly, and adaptable -creating a reliable digital home for
                the choir's community.

            <h2>Project Context</h2>
            <p>
                This project was part of the TLE module, where our challenge was to solve a real-world problem for an
                external client. Popkoor Singing Beat needed a modern communication hub that would streamline
                their workflow, reduce confusion, and provide better support for choir members.
            </p>
            <p>
                We delivered a completely renewed platform that supports announcements, file sharing, agenda
                management, music pratice, and dynamic content editing -allowing the choir to operate more
                efficiently than ever before.
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                Within the team, I was fully responsible for the back-end development of the new Laravel application.
                This meant ensuring that all core logic functioned correctly -from handling data flow and processing
                user actions to implementing features that the admin and choir members rely on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I contributed to analyzing the limitations of the old website and translating the choir's needs into
                a stable and scalable back-end structure. I implemented the functional logic behind communication tools,
                music pratice features, file management, member management, and dynamic content editing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I supported the team by helping shape the system architecture and making sure the
                platform behaved reliably and efficiently. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in
                Laravel, collaborative development, and building real-world back-end solutions tailored to a
                client's wokrflow.
