            <h1>Dionysos Drinks</h1>
            <p>
                Dionysos Drinks is a web application designed to make choosing your next alcoholic drink effortless.
                Users can rate drinks they have tried, either overall or based on specific flavor notes, and the app
                provides personalized recommendations tailored to their tastes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The platform allows users to explore drinks through a browse tab with multiple categories, give
                feedback on recommendations, and receive suggestions filtered by flavor profiles such as sweet
                or bitter. Because Dionysos Drinks is a web app, it works across devices -including Android and
                iOS phones, Windows and Linux laptops, or even smart fridges -making it universally accesible.

            <h2>Project Context</h2>
            <p>
                The problem addressed by Dionysos Drinks is that many people struggle to choose an alcoholic
                drink from the overwhelming variety available. The project was a self-initated web app, aiming
                to help users avoid picking drinks they might dislike. Using a rating-based algorithm, the app
                generates recommendations for each user based on their previous ratings, improving discovery and
                enjoyment of new beverages.
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                I independently developed Dionysos Drinks as a fully functional web app. I designed and implemented
                the algorithm that genrates personalized drink recommendations based on user ratings. I also
                handled the full front-end development, including browsing, rating interfaces, and the recommendation
                dashboard, ensuring the app is responsive and works across different devices. Additionally, I designed
                the user experience, integrated feedback mechanisms, and managed the project from concept to web app.
