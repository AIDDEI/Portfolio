            <h1>FIFA 23 Career Mode Helper</h1>
            <p>
                For the course Programming 8, I created a FIFA 23 Career Mode Helper that uses machine learning to
                assist FIFA 23 players in estimating a football player's potential and determining their most
                suitable in-game positions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using ML5, I trained my own machine learning model based on collected data. After training,
                I integrated the model into a JavaScript application, allowing users to input player stats and
                receive predictions generated by the model.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result is a helpful tool for FIFA 23 Career Mode fans, giving them deeper insights into
                player development and aiding them in building stronger teams.

            <h2>Project Context</h2>
            <p>
                This project was developed for the course Programming 8, where the goal was to explore machine learning
                concepts and create a pratical application using ML5.
            </p>
            <p>
                The challenge involved gathering data, training a model, validating the results, and integrating the
                trained model into a working JavaScript interface. The tool needed to be functional, user-friendly,
                and demonstrate how machine learning can be used.
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                I was responsible for the full development of the tool, including training the ML5 model, preparing the
                training data, and implementing the application logic in JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                I built the system that loads the trained model, processes user input, and generates predictions for
                both player potential and optimal playing positions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the project, I gained experience with machine learning fundamentals, model training
                workflows, and integrating ML models into front-end applications.
            </p>
