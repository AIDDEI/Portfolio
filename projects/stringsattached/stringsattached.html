            <h1>Strings Attached</h1>
            <p>
                Step into the surreal world of Strings Attached, a hand crafted 2D mobile game!
            </p>
            <p>
                You play as Pips, a puppet-like circus performer who finds himself hanging awake on an endless tightrope
                in a bizarre circus tent. The circusmaster's haunting whisper urges him to dance forever. As strange
                objects shower down and props tumble over the rope, Pips must dodge, jump, hang, and dash to survive -
                and break free from the endless performance before he becomes just another puppet in the show.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tilt your device to walk the rope, swipe up to jump, swipe down to hang, hold to crouch and swipe
                sideways to dash through danger. Every meter walked brings you closer to uncovering fragments of the
                characters' backstories hidden within the circus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlock new performers and experience their personal journeys:
                <br>
                - Toots, a young girl seeking the attention she never received at home, joins the circus in search of
                appreciation - yet still yearns for her parents' love.
                <br>
                - Daps, a professional clown who can't stand the silence after his failed jokes, decides to start anew
                as a tightrope walker. Protective and kind-hearted, he looks after Toots as if she were his own
                daughter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earn tickets to unlock new characters, and reveal the dark whimsical stories behind each performer. Can
                you walk the rope long enough to set them free - or will you become part of the circusmaster's eternal
                circus?
            </p>

            <h2>Project Context</h2>
            <p>
                During the CMI Game Minor, I worked together with four other students to develop a 2D Unity game for
                mobile devices. We had six weeks to build a fully playable game from scratch. The result of this project
                is our game <b>Strings Attached</b>!
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                I was the sole developer on the team, which meant I programmed all the game logic and functionality in
                C#. In addition, I ensured that thorough documentation was created, covering the code structure, version
                control workflow, and user stories. I also handled the sound design for the game.
            </p>
