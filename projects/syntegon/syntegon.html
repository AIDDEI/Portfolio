            <h1>Syntegon Schiedam</h1>
            <p>
                During the COVID-19 pandemic, not all employees were allowed to be physically present at
                Syntegon's office in Schiedam. To help manage workplace capacity, I developed a custom
                reservation system that allows employees to book desks across various departements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through the system, users can select a workplace, set specific time ranges for their reservation,
                and easily modify or cancel existing bookings. The platform simplifies day-to-day planning, ensures
                safe workplace distribution, and provides Syntegon with an organized and efficient way to manage
                office occupancy.

            <h2>Project Context</h2>
            <p>
                This system was built for Syntegon Schiedam during a period when COVID-19 restrictions
                required flexible workplace scheduling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal was to create a practical digital solution that would support employees in
                managing their presence in the office while adhering to the regulations. PHP and SQL were
                used to implement a stable, secure and user-friendly reservation environment.
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                I was responsible for developing the entire back-end logic using PHP and SQL. This included
                creating the database structure, building the reservation functionality, implementing time-based
                booking options, and enabling users to edit or remove their reservations.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work ensured that the system accurately processed reservations, prevented conflicts, and provided
                employees with a smooth and reliable booking experience.
            </p>
