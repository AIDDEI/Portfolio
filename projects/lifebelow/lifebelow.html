            <h1>Life Below Water</h1>
            <p>
                This game was developed to contribute to the SDG Life Below Water. Working with a team
                of five students, we created an interactive educational game for the Hoogheemraadschap van
                Schieland en de Krimpenerwaard. The game teaches children about water systems, water
                management, and the role of Dutch water boards. Developed in Typescript using PIXI.js, the
                game combines educational content and interactive challenges to make learning about water
                fun and accessible for young audiences.

            <h2>Project Context</h2>
            <p>
                Our team was tasked with desiging an educational solution to raise awareness about water
                management and SDG Life Below Water. Through a combination of desk research and field research,
                we developed a game that introduces children to the importance of water systems in the Netherlands,
                helping them understand both local an national water management practices.
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                I contributed to both development and technical implementation. Specifically, I designed and implemented
                the UI for the game, including the start screen, settings screen, and interactive buttons across other
                screens. I also created and integrated sound effects to enhance the player experience. Additionally, I
                assisted in reviewing and testing teammates' code to ensure functionality and consistency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the technical work, I took responsibility for several practical and project management tasks. I
                drafted a team collaboration agreement to ensure all members adhered to shared expectations. I
                conducted market research to analyze existing educational products an gain insights for our game
                design. Furthermore, I defined Jobs to Be Done, developed value propositions, and created a
                Business Model Canvas to structure and communicate our project strategy effectively.
